## What is Inkscape?

### Inkscape is a free and open-source vector graphics editor. It's similar to Adobe Illustrator or CorelDRAW but is available for free, making it a popular choice for artists, designers, and anyone working with vector graphics. Inkscape allows users to create and edit scalable vector graphics (SVG) files, which are ideal for logos, icons, illustrations, and other graphic design projects. It supports various features such as shapes, paths, text, gradients, transparency, and more. Additionally, Inkscape supports extensions and has a vibrant community that contributes to its development, offering additional functionality through plugins and scripts.
